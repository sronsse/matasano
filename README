The Matasano crypto challenges is a collection of 48 exercises that
demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto. The series can be found here:

From the official website: "This is a different way to learn about crypto than
taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived
from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We
give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself.
When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how
cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked."

This project is meant to host solutions to these various exercises using the C
language.
